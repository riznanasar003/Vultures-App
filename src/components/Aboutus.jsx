                        <p>In the world of human endeavors, the vulture metaphor takes on a similar meaning. Here, the "vulture" represents someone who is adept at spotting opportunities, often when misfortune strikes. They have a knack for identifying situations where they can gain an advantage, even if it arises from someone else's struggles. This metaphor can have a bit of a sting to it. It implies that the person is more interested in the potential benefit than the cause of the situation. They might be seen as insensitive or even predatory. However, the vulture metaphor isn't always negative. Sometimes, it simply describes someone with a sharp eye for opportunity. They're quick to recognize a chance and act on it, which can be a valuable skill for success. Ultimately, the meaning of the "vulture grasping opportunities" metaphor depends on the context.  It's important to consider the speaker's intent and the specific situation to understand whether they're highlighting the opportunistic or simply the observant nature of the person in question.</p>
